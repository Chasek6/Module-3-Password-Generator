Description 
The Module 3 challenge was to create a Random Password Generator using Script.js file.

The goal of creating a Random Password Generator was to learn and apply Javascript methods, functions,for loops, prompts, events and alerts.

I was successfully able to deploy a Random Password Generator webpage that would take 128 characters & generate a random password based off: how many characters the user wants and rather or not the user wants uppercase or lowercase letter as well as special characters and numbers.
